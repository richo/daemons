= Daemons Version 0.3.0

(See Releases for release-specific information)

== What is Daemons?

Daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby scripts (for example a self-written server) 
to be <i>run as a daemon</i> and to be <i>controlled by simple start/stop/restart commands</i>.

Besides this basic functionality, daemons offers many advanced features like <i>exception backtracing</i> 
and logging (in case your ruby script crashes) and <i>monitoring</i> and automatic restarting of your processes
if they crash.

Daemons includes the <tt>daemonize.rb</tt> script written by <i>Travis Whitton</i> to do the daemonization
process.

== Basic Usage

Layout: suppose you have your self-written server <tt>myserver.rb</tt>:

  # this is myserver.rb
  # it does nothing really useful at the moment
  
  loop do
    sleep(5)
  end
  
To use <tt>myserver.rb</tt> in a production environment, you need to be able to
run <tt>myserver.rb</tt> in the _background_ (this means detach it from the console, fork it
in the background, release any directories and file descriptors).

Just create <tt>myserver_control.rb</tt> like this:

  # this is myserver_control.rb
  
  require 'rubygems'        # if you use RubyGems
  require 'daemons'
  
  Daemons.run('myserver.rb')
  
And use it like this from the console:

  $ ruby myserver_control.rb start
      (myserver.rb is now running in the background)
  $ ruby myserver_control.rb restart
      (...)
  $ ruby myserver_control.rb stop
  
For testing purposes you can even run <tt>myserver.rb</tt> <i>without forking</i> in the background:

  $ ruby myserver_control.rb run

An additional nice feature of Daemons is that you can pass <i>additional arguments</i> to the script that 
should be daemonized by seperating them by two _hyphens_:
  
  $ ruby myserver_control.rb start -- --file=anyfile --a_switch another_argument
