= Daemons Release History

== Release 0.4.4: February 14, 2006

* Several fixes that allow us to use the Daemons::Controller 
  with a proc instead of wrapping a script file. This gives us all the
  PID file management, monitoring, command line options, etc. without having
  to specify a path to our script which can be tricky, especially when using
  RubyGems. (thanks to John-Mason Shackelford)

== Release 0.4.3: November 29, 2005

* New Option: You can specify the name of the application with :app_name
  on calling Daemons.run. This will be used to contruct the name of the pid files
  and log files. Defaults to the basename of the script. (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)

* Bugfix: Handle the case where no controller options are given when calling Daemons, 
  just options after "--". (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)


== Release 0.4.2: November 15, 2005

* Bugfix for problem with :normal pid-file directory mode (pid.rb), fixed (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)

== Release 0.4.0: July 30, 2005

  2. Daemonize the currently running process (<tt>Daemons.daemonize</tt>)
  plus the already existing mode to control your scripts (<tt>Daemons.run("script.rb")</tt>)
* Improved documentation (for example "How does the daemonization process work?")

* Some minor bugfixes
